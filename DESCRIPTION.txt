VirtuAlias wraps the virtualenv command, adding aliases for the environments.

VirtuAlias is a minimal wrapper for virtualenv. It will simply create a new alias
(actually, a function) everytime you create a new environment, allowing you to switch
between them. Functions are appended to a new file (.virtualias_functions) in the
user home folder.

Note: this is a pretty basic script. If you are looking for something more, then
you are probably looking for virtualenvwrapper.
